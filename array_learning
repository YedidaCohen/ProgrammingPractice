#Create array
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(numbers)

#Print first and last numbers in array
print("First:", numbers[0])
print("Last:", numbers[-1])

#Modifying arrays
numbers.append(60)
numbers.insert(2, 25) #adds the number 25 at index 2
print("Added the number 25 to index 2:", numbers)
numbers.remove(40) #removes the actual number 40
    #If number is not in array, you will get an error
print("Removed the number 40:", numbers)
numbers[0] = 5 #changes the first number to 5
print("Changed the first number to 5:", numbers)

#Loop through an array
for num in numbers:
    print(num + 2)
    #prints each number in the array (plus 2) on a seperate line

#Searching and slicing
    #Slicing allows you to take part of an array/list and put in different variable without changing the original
    #You specify start and end index. Syntax: subArray: originalArray[0:3]... this gives first 3 numbers
    #The end index does NOT include that number
#Search:
if 30 in numbers:
    print("30 is in the array")
else:
    print("30 is not in the array")

#Splice:
firstThree = numbers[0:3]
print("The first 3 numbers in array are:", firstThree)

#Other array functions

print("Max number in array is:", max(numbers))
print("Min number in array is:", min(numbers))

#Reverse array
    #You can't assign numbers.reverse() to a new variable. You probably first have to make a copy of array and then reverse the 
        #copy if you want to keep original array too
numbers.reverse()
print("Reversed array:", numbers)

#Array manipulation
#Practice 1: multiply each even number by 3
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:
        numbers[i] *= 3
print("Multiplied even numbers by 3:", numbers)

#Practice 2: Remove all numbers greater than 50
 #At first I tried looping through the length of numbres, but it gave an out of index error because once you start removing
 #elements from the array, then there will be no numbers in the later indexes.
  #So, other options are either looping backwards, or creating a new array

copyNumbers = numbers[:]

  #Looping backwards:
for i in range(len(copyNumbers)-1, -1, -1):  #range(start, stop, step)
                                                #start: len(numbers) - 1 ... this means start at the last index
                                                #stop: we want to stop at index 0, but python stops before the stop number, so -1
                                                #step: -1 means go backwards one index at a time
    if copyNumbers[i] > 50:
        copyNumbers.remove(copyNumbers[i])
print(copyNumbers)

  #Creating new array:
filteredNumbers = []
for num in numbers:
    if num <= 50:
        filteredNumbers.append(num) #creates a new array of all numbers < 50 because we want to remove all numbers > 50
numbers = filteredNumbers
print(numbers)
